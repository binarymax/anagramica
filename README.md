## A word game and API for anagrams 

### About:
Anagramica is a game I originally wrote in a weekend in November 2011, and then expanded with features on another weekend.  I originally had the idea for the game after wanting to learn CSS3 transforms and had a vision of flipping letters around on a board, like Wheel of Fortune or something.  I wanted to do something somewhat original, and had the idea for the acronym finding algorithm in my head ever since reading Programming Pearls (which is a great book).  The game runs with a node backend, and works in all modern browsers - even in IE8!  Features I thought of but never implemented, were to implement 2 player head-to-head, and a better touch UI.

### Play:
A playable version is available at http://anagramica.com
